This repository demonstrates an uncommon code error in Scala related to implicit resolution ambiguity. The `MyClass` uses an implicit parameter `ev: T => Ordered[T]` in the method `myMethod`. When T is Int, it works fine, but when T is String, it fails to compile because there might be multiple implicit conversions for String to Ordered[String], leading to ambiguity. The solution shows how to resolve this by providing an explicit conversion or improving type definition.
